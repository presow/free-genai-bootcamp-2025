### 🗒️ Sentence Structure Clues  

1. **"Good morning"**  
   - In Tamil, greetings like "Good morning" are often a single phrase instead of two separate words.  
   - Think of **"Good" (நல்ல)** and **"Morning" (காலை)** together.  

2. **"I am going to camping today."**  
   - **Subject** → "I" (நான்)  
   - **Time** → "Today" (இன்று)  
   - **Verb** → "Going" (போகிறேன்)  
   - **Object** → "Camping" (முகாம்)  
   - Tamil doesn’t use "am" separately like English; the verb conjugation includes it.  

### 🔍 Clues to Build the Sentence  

- "Good morning" is commonly said as **[Think of a common Tamil greeting using "morning"].**  
- "I am going to camping today" should follow the structure:  
  **[Subject] [Time] [Object] [Verb].**  
- The verb "going" changes depending on who is speaking. Since it's **"I,"** use the correct verb form from the table.  
- The word **"to"** is often implied and not separately used like in English.
